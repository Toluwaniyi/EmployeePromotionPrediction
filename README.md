# EmployeePromotionPrediction
A certain company in Nigeria has the data of certain employees and if they were Promoted(1) or Not(0).
We are to develop a prediction model to work on the test data and determine which employees should be given a promotion.
The column names are self-explanatory.
I use two models both using an XGBoost Classifier.
Code compiled on the Google Colab
